Heartphones
===========

The heartPhones system is an exploration of the ways citizen data and the quantified
self can help contribute to a healthier, more productive learning environment.

The heartPhones system is made of two parts: the physical interface integrated into a
pair headphones, and the web interface that connects to the headphones via Xively.
The physical interface monitors the user’s heart rate, sends it to Xively and activates a
colored LED that indicates a low, medium or high stress level [see diagram 1]. The
mobile-friendly web interfaces tracks the user’s heart rate throughout the day and
returns a visual cue on your screen. If your heart is too high for too long, the web
interface will activate a mediation in your browser.
